🔥 **Official repository for the paper:**  
**"Multi-Microphone and Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition in Reverberant Environments"**  
This work is an extension of our previous paper "Multi-Microphone Speech Emotion Recognition using the Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer
Architecture", incorporating multi-modal learning to further improve robustness.

## 🔍 Overview
Human emotions are conveyed through **speech and facial expressions**, making **multi-modal emotion recognition (MER)** crucial for robust emotion classification. This work introduces a **multi-microphone, multi-modal system** combining:

- **HTS-AT Transformer** for multi-channel audio processing
- **R(2+1)D ResNet CNN** for video-based emotion recognition
- **Late fusion concatenation** to combine audio & video features

### 🔮 Key Features
✔️ **Multi-Microphone Audio Processing**: Robust against reverberation  
✔️ **Multi-Modal Learning**: Combines speech and facial cues  
✔️ **Tested on RAVDESS with Real-World RIRs** (ACE Database)  
✔️ **Pretrained Models Available** for Fine-Tuning and testing

## 📸 Model Architecture
Our approach consists of **two main components**:
1. **HTS-AT Transformer (Audio Modality)**:
   - Processes **multi-channel mel-spectrograms**
   - Uses **Patch-Embed Summation & Averaging strategies**
   - Extracts **deep features** for robust emotion classification
2. **R(2+1)D CNN (Video Modality)**:
   - Extracts spatiotemporal features from facial expressions
   - Pretrained on **Kinetics dataset**, fine-tuned for MER
3. **Feature Fusion & Classification**:
   - Late fusion via **concatenation of extracted embeddings**
   - Fully connected layers for final emotion classification

## 🔧 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Installation**
The base way to run the code is with Docker Container.
#### **Pull Docker Image**
```bash
docker pull ohadico97/mer:v1
```
#### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multi-Modal-SER.git
cd Multi-Modal-SER
```
#### **Use the Virtual Environment**
```bash
Python 3.8.13 ('base')
```

---

### **2️⃣ Dataset Setup**
The previous paper evaluated the models on three datasets: **RAVDESS**, **IEMOCAP**, and **CREMA-D**. In this work, we focus exclusively on the **RAVDESS** dataset. The **training and validation splits** are reverberated synthetically using the **'gpuRIR' Python library**, while the **test sets** are reverberated with real-world ACE RIRs recorded in various acoustic environments. You can choose which modality to fine-tune using the ``` multimodal``` flag in ```config.py```.

      │── data/
            │── train.npy
            │── val.npy
            │── test.npy
```

### **3️⃣ Training & Evaluation**
#### **Preprocess Data**
```bash
python src/preprocess.py --dataset ravdess --rir_data ACE
```
#### **Train the Multi-Modal Model**
```bash
python train.py --dataset ravdess --epochs 150 --batch_size 64
```
#### **Evaluate Performance**
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset ravdess --rir_data ACE
```
